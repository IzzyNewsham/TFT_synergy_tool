# TFT synergy tool

This is a Jupyter Notebook tool to help you craft your TFT (Teamfight Tactics) teams in real time. TFT is a game with characters from League of Legends, where you craft your team of characters with 'synergies' to try to win battles against other teams.


I created this because I found TFT to have a very steep learning curve, having never played league. This will help new players (and when new player sets come in) work out which synergies there are and where the intersection of different synergies are. Unfortunately this doesn't help with items!


If you just want to give it a go, see tft_synergy_tool.ipynb.


Note the team selector will probably not work in Jupyter lab (due to issues with ipywidgets).
